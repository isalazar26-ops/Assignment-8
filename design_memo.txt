A hash table is the ideal data structure for this contact management system becayse it allows for extremely fast lookups, insertions, and updates. Instead of scanning through every contact as a list would require, a hash table uses a hash function to conver a contact's name into a specific index in an array. This lets the program access or store a contact in near-constant time, even as the number of contavts grows into the hundreds. This performance advantage is critical for devices with limited memory or processing power.

In this implementation, collisions are handled using separate chaining. Each index in the hash table stores the head of a linked list made up of Node objects. When two contacts hash to the same index, they are linked together in this list. This method ensures that no data is overwritten or lost. If a contact with the same name is inserted again, the system updates the phone number rather than adding a duplicate entry.

An engineer might choose a hash table over a list or tree when fast access time is the priority and data ordering is not required. Lists are simple but slow for searches, and trees maintain order but have more overhead. Hash tables strike a balance by offering O(1) average lookup and insertion time, making them ideal for quick name-to-number lookups in this contact management system.
